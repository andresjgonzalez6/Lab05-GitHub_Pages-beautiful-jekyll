Wow, it has been a long time since my last update!

I have been doing well lately: I have been running several times a week and exercising every day. The physical activity has done wonders for my health, and I am in a much better shape than I have been, well, always really.
I have recently added meditation to my morning routine, and it is helping me find clarity of mind and stability.

I am hoping I will have more time and energy to make new art and to update this blog now that I have handed over my role as coordinator of the sceptic groups I was handling, but right now I am not feeling very creative.
I think this might have to do with the fact that I was drained and  I still need to recover and get my energy back.

In addition to drawing and updating this blog, there are other things I would like to do: I want to improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS, learn Javascript, learn Python 3, and keep a journal with my daily intentions and gratitude.

I am not sure I can fit all this stuff in my day since commuting and working at the office occupy a big chunk of my 24 hours, but I know I can utilise my time better with some planning.  I guess we will see...
