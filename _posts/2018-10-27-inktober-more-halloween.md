It is grey and rainy here, so finally it looks like proper autumn, which means I'll spend my afternoon curled up on the couch with a cup of hot tea, watching my partner play Red Dead Redemption 2.

Between last night and today, I completed another entry for the [inktober](https://inktober.com/) challenge, and I am actually pretty happy with it.

The combination of markers and metallic ink is quite addictive: I am loving the results so much, I'll most likely do more of these in the near future.
