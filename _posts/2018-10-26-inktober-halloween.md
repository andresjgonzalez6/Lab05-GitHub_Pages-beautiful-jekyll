November is almost here, and I am in a Halloween mood even though the weather here in Italy is still summer-ish.

I have been participating in the [inktober](https://inktober.com/) challenge, though sporadically, and I must say I have enjoyed working with inks again after such a long art hiatus.

The challenge has certainly re-kindled my creativity, and I am hoping I will keep up in the following months.
I do want to update this blog more often (more than twice a year, it shouldn't be hard!), and making and uploading more art seems like the perfect way of letting my creative juice flow and keeping this blog more active.
