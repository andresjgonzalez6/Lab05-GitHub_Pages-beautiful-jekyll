Here I am again, failing to keep up with my blog.
There were so many things I wanted to write about, but in the end, I went through a few months of depression and barely had the energy to take care of work-related stuff, and of my duties with the sceptics association for which I volunteer.

So many things happened between my last update and now, mostly positive:

I started running again. I have been trying to run again for a while, but my previous attempts had failed for various reasons, physical and emotional. This time though, I managed to overcome all those obstacles, and physically I am almost back to where I was years ago before I had to stop for minor surgery.
Mentally, however, I am in a much better place, since I am now able of doing it just for my health, instead of as a competition with myself where I would get obsessed with my performance and with never missing my training.

I have organised a series of very successful events for the sceptics association in which I am volunteering. 
Working at these events has been, and still is, very satisfying, and it has allowed me to grow as a person, meet wonderful people, and to learn.
I will be forever grateful for the time spent with this association, but I feel like it is time for me to retire from my position of chapter coordinator. I do need to return to hobbies that I find more relaxing and require fewer responsibilities, like drawing, playing video games, and all those things that help me unload my mind in the evening and weekends.

Maybe it's the stomach bug speaking (one of the not so nice things that happened to me lately), but I am feeling contempt for the first time after some long, dark months spent balancing between my anxiety and depression.

I am looking forward to keeping up with the positive mindset, and with this blog.
