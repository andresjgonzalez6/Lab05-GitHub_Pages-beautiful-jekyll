I am planning an update to this blog's "backend" - so to speak. I will definitely keep Dean's amazing theme [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/), but I am getting tired of the changes I made to the stylesheet and the theme itself has undergone many updates since when I installed it - the last one doing somethig I had already done, but much better.

I am also considering the option of building the blog locally, though I enjoy how easy it is to update the blog now that it's build by GitHub Pages automatically.

The blog might look a bit weird in the next few days and over the weekend, but it's really easy to restore old posts, so I expect it to be back up fairly quickly.
(Unless I just jinxed it, that is...)
